    <p>Swimming is my favorite sport. It is basically <br>the only sport I am good at because I don't have <br>good cordination. Swimming also doesn't hurt my back<br> like other sports would. I have a back injury and<br> swimming actually relieves some of the pain. </p>

    <p>My favorite things about swimming<br>
    is how easy the sport is for me.<br>
  For some people swimming can be<br>
really hard, but it just comes <br>
naturally for me. I also love the<br>
teams I swim with. Everyone is<br>
supportive and its like a mini family.</p>

    <p>The events I usually swim <br>
    in a meet are the 100 free <br>
  and 50 free. I swim these <br>
because I am very good at the <br>
stroke. I can swim the 100 under<br>
a minute and the 50 in under 27<br>
seconds. I am happy with these<br>
times because I qualify for states.</p>
